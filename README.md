# Collections-Overview
A complete overview and simplified explanation for Collection Framework in Java

# 1. What is a Collection ?
Acollection is an object to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity.

# 2. What is Collection Framework? 
Collection framework is the group of all the collection interfaces, classes, implementations and algorithm that are used to represent
a group of individual object as a single entity. 
It was introduced in Java SE 1.2. Prior to that Java initially had few collection classes: Vector, Stack, Hashtable, Properties. 
These classes were also reengineered to accomodate the changes intorduced in Java 1.2 version.

# Some Benefits of Collection Framework:
1. Reduced Development Effort - as classes are available ready to use.
2. Improved Code quality - with the use of well tested collection framework classes
3. Reduced effort for code maintenance.
4. Reusability and Interoperability.

# 3. What were the changes introduced in JDK5 ?
With the introduction of JDK5, some fundamental changes were made to collections framework that significantly increased its power
and streamlined its use.
These changes were:
1. Addition of generics. - this intorduced TYPE SAFETY.
2. Autoboxing and Unboxing. - it facilitated the storing of primitive types in collection.
3. For-each style for loop. - reduced usage of iterator based loops
